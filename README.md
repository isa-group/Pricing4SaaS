# Pricing4SaaS

## Context

Pricing within the realm of Software as a Service (SaaS) is a complex and dynamic undertaking, blending the elements of both art and science. They were adopted by API developers from other sectors to profit from their technology, whose objective was to limit third-party access to the software, coining terms such as quota and rate that governed its use. Their evolution in the software industry has been a remarkable phenomenon, as many companies adopted the strategy and applied it to their SaaS products, leading to new strategies of pricing plans. These plans do not only impose usage limitations, but they also empower users to select the desired level of SLA coverage and access specific features tailored to their needs.

## Structure

The labpack contains three main folders:

- **datasets**: contains the .xlsx dataset file consumed by the notebook to extract results. It is contains the analyses conducted on thirteen distinct SaaS platforms annually, spanning from 2019 to 2023.
- **model**: which is divided into another two:
-- **diagrams**: within this folder you'll find the version history of Pricing4SaaS, including its various design iterations. To each version correspond an editable file with the corresponding PNG.
-- **yamls**: contains the serialization of pricings made with the Yaml4SaaS syntax, explained in `pricing4saas-report.pdf`
- **notebooks**: encompasses all the essential materials for reproducing our empirical experiment. `functions.py` contains the functions used in `pricingStatistics.ipynb`, and both `figures` and `statisticsResutls`  house the exported files of the figures generated by the notebook. Finally, `requirement.txt` contains the set of python packages needed to run the study locally.
- **scripts**: contains the scripts used to analyze Yaml4SaaS serialized in search of mismatches.
- **webs**: contains the snapshots of the webpages of the SaaS platforms analyzed in the study that could not be accessed through the Wayback Machine.

As the main component of the lab pack, pricing4saas-report.pdf serves as an expanded version of the experiment. Within this document, a comprehensive breakdown of all the extracted data for the analyzed pricings, categorized by year, is provided. Additionally, the file includes specifications for the **Yaml4SaaS** syntax.
